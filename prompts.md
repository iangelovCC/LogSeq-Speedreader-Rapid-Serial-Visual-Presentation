## LogSeq RSVP Speed-Reading Plugin
1. Create a LogSeq plugin which is a fully funtioning, tested by you prior to ouput, port of the Reedy-for-Chrome extension. The plugin should implement Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) speed-reading technique, allowing users to read LogSeq pages or selected text blocks one word at a time at customizable speeds (up to 10,000 WPM). Include features such as start/pause/stop controls, keyboard shortcuts, progress bar, font customization, markdown compatibility, punctuation handling options, and gradual acceleration/deceleration. Ensure the plugin is fully compatible with LogSeq's existing features and plugin framework. For reference, see the project purpose and features outlined in the provided context in the context.md file.
2. Upon completing the full and tested port, present me with the complete source code of the LogSeq RSVP Speed-Reading Plugin, along with detailed instructions on how to install and use it within LogSeq. Make sure that the code is truly plugin-ready and has been verified to work as intended. Additionally, include a troubleshooting section to help users resolve common issues they might encounter during installation or usage.
